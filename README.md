### Wordesaurus

A personal project developed in CS 361 Software Engineering I at Oregon State University in Winter 2023 term.
I developed a real-world application using Node.js and Javascript to retrieve and display information about words from
a words API through Rapid API using asynchronous Axios calls. 

The program includes a front-end website, using CSS, HTML, React, Bootstrap, and a microservice developed by another classmate which communicates via a RabbitMQ pipeline.

The keys used in the original version to make API requests were removed so this project could be published publicly.

The project incorporated an Agile workflow involving Sprints, User Stories, Functional and Non-Functional requirements, and a communication contract with my classmate.
